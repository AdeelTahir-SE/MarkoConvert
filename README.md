# How It Works
## 1. Write Markdown
Use the text editor in the app to write in Markdown syntax. A live preview of the HTML output will be displayed on the right side of the screen as you type.

## 2. Preview Markdown as HTML
The app uses a Markdown parser to convert your text into formatted HTML, allowing you to see how your notes will look once published or exported.

## 3. Save Markdown Files
When you're ready, click the Save button to save your notes as a .md file. The app will download the file to your local system.

## 4. Drag and Drop Markdown Files
You can drag and drop existing .md files into the app, and the content will be loaded into the editor. This allows you to easily view and edit existing Markdown files.

## 5.   Saved Files
The app lists previously saved Markdown files. Simply click on a file name to open it, view its contents, and continue editing.
